						<p><b style="font-size: 22px;">The Similarity Checker(Argos)
						</b><br>
					 The aim was to build an Intelligent system to suggest a similar change request from the backlogs to one on which an associate is currently working. This helped to reduce the backlogs of defects and improve the efficiency of the team.<br>
				1. Extracted out the change request data from various data sources.<br>
			  2. Analyzed and processed the collected data composed of text (CR Summary & Description) written by associates/clients, which are unstructured.<br>
		    3. Used NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization to prepare the text data.<br>
			  4. Implemented corpus, TF-IDF algorithm to make a term document matrix from the cleaned and processed text.<br>
			  5. Used cosine similarity as the parameter to find out the similarity amongst the Change requests.<br>

						The aim was to build an Intelligent system to suggest a similar change request from the backlogs to one on which an associate is currently working. This helped to reduce the backlogs of defects and improve the efficiency of the team.<br>
						1. Extracted out the JIRA data from various data sources of the last two years for 5 different solutions.<br>
					  2. Analyzed and processed the collected text summary and description of collected JIRA<br>
				    3. Used NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization to prepare the text data.<br>
						4. Divided data into 80% training, 10% validation,and 10% testing sets.<br>
					  5. Implemented corpus, TF-IDF algorithm to make a term document matrix from the cleaned and processed text.<br>
					  6. Used cosine similarity as the parameter to find out the similarity amongst the Change requests.<br>

						<p><b style="font-size: 22px;">The Sleepbuds App</b><br>
						Created an android mobile app for Bose. The application was for sleep buds, where the user would connect to those buds and play soothing sounds from the app's sound library. Here I worked as a senior developer and developed the complete audio library module<br>

						</p>

						<hr />
						<p><b style="font-size: 22px;">Augmented Reality App</b><br>
						The main objective was to add an augmented reality(AR) functionality to the Argos app. The intent was to improve the user experience so that the user can see the product in 3D and visualize how it would look in his surroundings<br>
            Research: Studied how horizontal plane detection is carried out by ARcore and developed a prototype to recognise vertical planes using the same.<br>

						<hr />
						<p><b style="font-size: 22px;">Product Search App</b><br>
						<b>The objective was to implement a barcode-based search functionality into the app as we wanted that when a user visits a store and sees a product, he should be able to see the price of the product just by scanning the barcode present on the product.<br>

						<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Chest X-rays based Pneumonia Classification	</b><br>
						</br><b>Problem Statement: To identify Pneumonia by using Chest X-ray’s, classify infected vs normal chest X-ray’s using the images of the chest X-ray’s.<br>
						<b>Solution Implementation: Developed a model for classifying the chest X-ray’s. Selected model employs MonkAI based word embedding fused and passed into datasets, followed by Transfer Learning. This is then passed through a Resnet modelling and Densenet modelling.</a></b><br>

						<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Text classification Amazon Reviews</b><br>
						</br><b>Problem Statment: To Classify the Labels of the Amaxon Reviews into Two Category Labeled.</a></b><br>
						<b> Solution Implementation: The dataset consists of 10,000 reviews which are classified into 'Label 1' and 'Label 2'. The attached file has two columns 'Text' and 'Label'.Used Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to predict and label content.</a></b><br>

						<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Digit Recognizer</b><br>
						</br><b> Implemented a system that analyses various type of Hand written Digits from 0-9. </a></b><br>
						</b><b>Dataset gathered from MNSIT resources and clean the data according to our requirements. Trained the model on more than 1000's labeled images for hand written numbers shape type detection.</a></b><br>

						</br><b>To identify the best question authors on the platform. This identification will bring more insight into increasing the user engagement. Given the tag of the question, number of views received, number of answers, username and reputation of the question author, the problem requires you to predict the upvote count that the question will receive.</a></b><br>

						<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Stock Tweets Prediction</b><br>
						</br><b>A hedge fund uses 6 financial factors to predict the alpha signal in a stock. This alpha signal is used to make purchase decisions about the stock. The hedge fund now collected and tagged microblogging data for sentiment from the Social Media platform called ‘StockTwits’.StockTwits is used by people who regularly trade stocks. People on this platform tweet about stocks using the special character ‘$’ to indicate the name of the stock. These microblogs similar to tweets might contain important information about the alpha signal in a stock.Your goal is to build a sentiment analysis model using the tagged data. This sentiment analysis model should then be used to generate a new stock factor which together with the other stock factors should be used to predict the Alpha Signal.The hedge fund has anonymised the data, which contains 7 stock factors and an alpha signal. This alpha signal is generated using a near perfect algorithmic trading strategy. Unfortunately the number of stock factors, collected to run that strategy,are extremely high and have to be collected from a large number of data vendors at a high price.</a></b><br>
